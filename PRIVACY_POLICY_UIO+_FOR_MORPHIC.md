User Interface Options Plus (UIO+) for Morphic allows you to customize websites to match your own personal needs and
preferences. Settings for the adaptations can be set via the UIO+ adjuster panel or, if on a
[Morphic](https://morphic.world) enable machine, from a keyed in preference set. Due to the nature of applying user
preferences, UIO+ for Morphic requires permission to interact with the web content in the browser's windows, tabs, and
iframes.

## Information UIO+ for Morphic collects

UIO+ for Morphic makes use of user preferences, collected via direct user input to its adjuster panel and from Morphic,
when run on a Morphic enabled machine. To apply certain adaptations, e.g. syllabifiaction and text-to-speech, the content
of active websites may be parsed.

## How UIO+ for Morphic uses the information

UIO+ for Morphic is directed by the user preferences to augment/adapt websites to the user's needs and preferences.
Typically this involves modifying the page styling, but may also require parsing website content (e.g syllabification,
text-to-speech).

## What information does UIO+ for Morphic share

UIO+ for Morphic only explicitly shares information with Morphic. All of the user preferences collected are stored
locally within the extension, for persistence across sessions. User preferences may also be shared to and from Morphic,
if on a Morphic enabled machine. Content parsed from websites is only stored temporarily, for the time needed to apply/
remove the adaptation. However, because the extension may need to communicate with injected scripts, modify HTML markup,
and/or apply styles within a website, it is possible that the website being adapted may be able to infer the user
preferences being applied.
